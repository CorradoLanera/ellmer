The goal of elmer is to provide a user friendly wrapper over the most common APIs for calling llm's. Major design goals include support for streaming and making it easy to register and call R functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of elmer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("hadley/elmer")
```

## Usage

To use elmer, you need an OpenAI API key. You can get one from [your developer console](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Then you should save that value as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in your `~/.Renviron` (an easy way to open that file is to call `usethis::use_renviron()`).
